![LaTeX2AI](/logo/logo_black.png?raw=true)

LaTeX2AI is a plugin for Adobe Illustrator that enables the use of text labels typeset in LaTeX inside an Illustrator document.
Currently LaTeX2AI supports:
- Illustrator CS6 (tested)
- Illustrator CC 2017
- Illustrator CC 2018
- Illustrator 2021 (tested)

## Requirements
Currently LaTeX2AI only works on Adobe Illustrator for Microsoft Windows.
The following software dependencies are required:
- A LaTeX compiler such as [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive) or [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org)
- [Ghost script](https://www.ghostscript.com)

## Install LaTeX2AI
Install LaTeX2AI from rebuild binaries can be downloaded from the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/isteinbrecher/latex2ai/releases).
They consist of two files `LaTeX2AI.aip` and `LaTeX2AIForms.exe`.
There are two ways to add LaTeX2AI to Illustrator:
- Both files can be copied to the default plug-in directory `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator <YOUR VERSION>\Plug-ins`, preferably into a subdirectory `LaTeX2AI` (for this method administrator privileges are required).
- Both files can be copied into an arbitrary directory and this directory has to be set as the Adobe Illustrator Plugin directory via `Edit/Preferences/Plug-ins & Scratch Disks.../Additional Plug-ins Folder`.

## Build LaTeX2AI from source

### Requirements
The additional requirements to build LaTeX2AI from source are:
- A C++ compiler has to be available on the system. This repository includes a Visual Studio 2017 solution for Windows.
- `python3` and `git` have to be available on the system.
- Environment variables:
  - `PYTHON_EXE` has to points to a valid `python3` executable on the system.
  - `ILLUSTRATOR_EXE` has to point to the illustrator executable on the system (this path is used for debugging).

### Getting started
1. Download and unpack the SDK depending on your Illustrator version:
  - [Adobe Illustrator CS6 SDK](http://download.macromedia.com/pub/developer/illustrator/sdk/AI_CS6_SDK_Win_682.6.1.zip)
  - [Adobe Illustrator CC and newer](https://console.adobe.io/downloads)
1. Go to the sample code folder `Adobe Illustrator <YOUR VERSION> SDK/sample code` and run
	```
	git clone https://github.com/isteinbrecher/latex2ai.git
	```
1. Go to `Adobe Illustrator <YOUR VERSION> SDK/sample code/LaTeX2AI` and run
	```
	git submodule update --init
	```
1. Open `Adobe Illustrator <YOUR VERSION> SDK/sample code/latex2ai/LaTeX2AI.sln` with Visual Studio, select the build type (*Release* or *Debug*) and the target (`x64`) and compile the solution.
   It might be necessary to change the *Windows SDK* version for `LaTeX2AI` and the *.NET Framework* version for `LaTeX2AIForms` to match the ones available on your system.
1. The compiled binaries are located at `Adobe Illustrator <YOUR VERSION> SDK/sample code/output/win/x64/<Debug/Release>`.
   This directory has to be set as the Plugin directory in Illustrator.
   The relevant files created, i.e. the ones needed to run LaTeX2AI are `LaTeX2AI.aip` and `LaTeX2AIForms.exe`.
   The executable `LaTeX2AIForms.exe` contains the UI for LaTeX2AI and should only be called from within the plugin itself.


# How to use LaTeX2AI
LaTeX2AI uses the *Placed Art* feature of Illustrator to embed LaTeX labels (compiled to `.pdf`) inside an Illustrator document.

The plugin adds four buttons to the main toolbar:

- ![Create / Edit](/l2a/resources/create_light.png?raw=true "Create / Edit") **Create / Edit**: Either create a new LaTeX2AI label or edit an existing one in the document.
- ![Redo items](/l2a/resources/redo_light.png?raw=true "Redo labels") **Redo LaTeX2AI labels**: This allows for the LaTeX recompilation and / or boundary box reset of all existing LaTeX2AI labels.
- ![LaTeX2AI options](/l2a/resources/options_light.png?raw=true "LaTeX2AI options") **LaTeX2AI options**: Open a form where the global LaTeX2AI options can be set. Also the LaTeX header can be opened in an external application.
- ![Save document as PDF](/l2a/resources/save_as_pdf_light.png?raw=true "Save document as PDF") **Save as PDF**: Save the current `.ai` document as a `.pdf` document with the same name. The LaTeX2AI labels are included into the created `.pdf` document.

Additionally, double clicking on a LaTeX2AI label enabled the editing mode.

## Create / Edit a LaTeX2AI label
The following form appears when creating or editing LaTeX2AI labels:

![Create / Edit](/doc/create-edit.png?raw=true "The LaTeX2aI Create / Edit form")

### Placement
This option defines how a label behaves when it its size changes.
Take for example the well-known formula `$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^k}{k!}$` which is placed inside a rectangle:

![Placement small](/doc/placement_small.png?raw=true)

The green box indicates the boundary box of the LaTeX2I label and the dot describes the placement of the label, i.e. if the size changes the position of this dot relative to the label will stay the same.
If the previous label is now changed to `\displaystyle` we get the following result:

![Placement large](/doc/placement_large.png?raw=true)

The size of the label changed due to a change in the underlying LaTeX code, but the position (the indicated dot) stayed the same.

#### Baseline placement
Additionally there is the possibility of a *baseline* placement.
This will result in a label where the baseline is exactly in the vertical center of the label.
The resulting label can now be easily adjusted and snapped to align with another baseline label or Illustrator text:

![Placement baseline](/doc/placement_baseline.png?raw=true)

### Stretch behavior
This option controls how a LaTeX2AI text label behaves when the size of the boundary box changes in Illustrator:

- **stretch** (default): The label always stretches to the boundary box dimensions.
- **remain original size**: Only the boundary box stretches, the label will remain in the correct size.

The following Figure illustrates the different options:

![Stretched labels](/doc/stretched_labels.png?raw=true)

Please note that the **remain original size** option leads to issues if the item is bend (see the red boxes in the previous Figure).

Every time a label changes the boundary box is reset so that it matches the size of the actual places PDF file.
With the **Redo items** button the boundary box of all labels can be redone.
It is generally advisable to redo all boundary boxes before exporting the Illustrator document, to ensure that the font size will be correct for each label.

## LaTeX header
It is assumed that all Illustrator files in the same directory use the same LaTeX header `LaTeX2AI_header.tex` (if no one exits in the directory, it will be created the first time it is needed).
This header can be edited to include packages and macros needed for the labels (LaTeX2AI supports `\input` commands in the header, also recursively).

## File structure
The `.pdf` files for the LaTeX labels are stored in the `links` subfolder of the document directory.
It is not required to keep track of the files in the `links` folder, LaTeX2AI manages and deletes unused label files.

# Known issues

## Missing image files
When opening a document after it is moved / copied it can happen that Illustrator can not find the `.pdf` files for the labels.
In that case the following warning message appears:
![Missing labels](/doc/missing_image_marked.png?raw=true)
The missing labels can be ignored by selecting `Apply to All` and `Ignore`.
After the document is loaded, LaTeX2AI automatically restores the missing items.

## Redo not working when changing an item
Redoing an item by double clicking on it will not trigger an individual undo entry.
The changes made in the redo process will be appended to the last undo entry.

To merge your changes into the main LaTeX2AI repository, create a pull request to the `develop` branch (this branch will be merged into `main` with the next release).
A few things to keep in mind:
- Compile a debug build and run the framework tests in Illustrator ![Framework tests](/l2a/resources/testing_light.png?raw=true "Framework tests").
  You might also consider adding tests for your changes (`./l2a/src/tests`).
- Run the `python3` script `check_license.py` to ensure that all added source files have the correct license header.
- LaTeX2AI uses `clang-format` to format the C++ code.
  Make sure to apply clang format to the changed source files (with the Visual Studio solution in the repository this should happen automatically).
